#### Statewise Analysis of India :
- Statewise Tree Map
-  Male or, Female, which community is more affected?
- Which age group is more effected?
- Statewise Recovery rate and Death rate
- Total Tested v/s Positive cases : analysis
- State v/s Testing labs
- Health facility condition analysis statewise
- State v/s Hospital Beds

### Prediction for India
- Prediction of the growth rate in the upcoming months
- Requirement of hospital beds v/s Confirmed cases
- When the states will be running out of hospital beds?
- How many beds we required to prevent the crisis (Statewise analysis)

### Conclusion
