# Covid-19 Analysis and Prediction - A Case Study using Machine Learning
*************************************************************************************

It's a Machine learning project where I have analyzed the current situation of Covid-19 of India with respect to the world and predicted the cases and outcomes of the analysis.

## Contents of the Project :

### Introduction

- Heatmap of the confirmed cases, recovered cases and death cases
- How many countries were effected by the virus?
- Percentage of confirmed cases per country
- Top 5 countries having most number of confirmed cases
 
### China : The first epicenter of the pandemic
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats
- Hubei Province

### World : Excluding China
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### Italy : The 2nd Epicenter 
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### USA : The 3rd Epicenter
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### South Korea : The most successful country against Covid-19
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### United Kingdom : Recovered from Covid-19 or, not?
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### Does Germany defeat Covid-19 like the UK did?
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### Does The Tech country Japan, overcome the situation?
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### Australia : How did they manage?
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats

### LOCKDOWN : The Saviour or, not?
- China
- Italy
- USA
- Germany
- united Kingdom
- Australia
- Japan

### India : the fastest growing epicenter
- Per day stats
- Curve of total number of confirmed, recovered and death cases
- Confirmed cases increased per day stats
- Death cases increased per day stats
- Lockdown of India

#### Statewise Analysis of India :
- Statewise Tree Map
-  Male or, Female, which community is more affected?
- Which age group is more effected?
- Statewise Recovery rate and Death rate
- Total Tested v/s Positive cases : analysis
- State v/s Testing labs
- Health facility condition analysis statewise
- State v/s Hospital Beds

### Prediction for India
- Prediction of the growth rate in the upcoming months
- Requirement of hospital beds v/s Confirmed cases
- When the states will be running out of hospital beds?
- How many beds we required to prevent the crisis (Statewise analysis)

### Conclusion

#### Thank you! Stay Home! Stay Safe!
